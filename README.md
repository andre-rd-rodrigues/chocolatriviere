# Chocolat de Riviére

Chocolat de Riviére is an original fictitious company project, inspired by my love of chocolate, conceived and built taking into account fair trade ethics and sustainability. Connecting cocoa-growing with luxury chocolate making and retailing makes us unique in Dublin and gives an in-depth understanding of the factors that impact the final flavor of our chocolate, right from the growing tree. This company is a start-up with high-quality chocolate, served by special services and packs. The main features that distinguish this company are fair trade, exquisite chocolate, and sustainability.
